# The NextGen Project


## What is the NextGen Project? 
The NextGen Project serves to create a modern language that allows integration with existing languages. For example, easily integrate the
**[Jet Programming Language](https://discord.gg/tft9Nw5jm6)** with Python, JavaScript, and run its code along with them in the browser, or
as web-backend. If you want to get low-level, integrate it with C-Libraries and headers, and avoid memory burdens with this language.

## The Jet Programming Language
The language was made with a clear intention to include features heavily requested by other developers into a language. Its design is also made with careful
consideration of current programming paradigms as well modern programming languages used in the industry. We are targetting both systems developers as well
frontend and backend web developers with this language. To get the best of all worlds, Jet will use generate code appropriately, even generating parts of 
its code in different languages. For example, you write both a frontend interface for your webapp along with the backend interface with your webapp, and
the compiler generates both JavaScript and Machine Code for the target and it works very nicely and is highly performant, and functions as well as another
webapp would. 

### Targets
The Jet Programming Language will target languages/backends that provide the most portability and performance.
Plans for targets include: **C**, **JavaScript**, **WASM**, and **Native CPU Architectures**.
These backends cover our 2 target audiences as well as provide, a more performant output.

## How do the authors intend on gathering support?
Our languages is on the [r/Programming Language Discord](https://discord.gg/tft9Nw5jm6) server and then proceed as the language gains gradual 
maturity. During this time, we would intend to join other forums to discuss our language design in hopes of reaching a wider developer community
as well as communicate with developers in the industry such as: **Amazon**, **Google**, **JP Morgan**, and much more. We are the works of developing
a language with fast project deployment time, and ease of syntax.

## Ok now this sounds great, but how do I contribute?
If you are reading this, you can make a change on our Github. To contribute, please see our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/The-NextGen-Project/jet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our policies that are listed there. Don't forget to read closely as to how to report issues and our code style guidelines as they are very important for maintining a good codebase. 

We are actively looking for other interested in this project, please apply [here](https://forms.gle/FV8VaQXcqTmUcJd78) to have a more involved
role in the language's development.
