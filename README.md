# The NextGen Project
### Unified Next Generation Toolchain for software and hardware integrations by unifying common toolsets via the Jet Programming Language.

### What is the NextGen Project? 
The NextGen Project serves to be the hub for creating and synthesizing new and old open source projects
into a unified toolchain under the Jet Programming Language. I know that there are several people who would love intgeration
with their programming language's backend. With targetting many backends, we hope to create a highly portable programming
language and toolchain.

### Why even attempt to create a unified language when there are so many existing ones designed for their platform?
Why not? There are currently many attempts to replace the *C Programming Language*, however, it is a quite a difficult task to even
begin. Why is this? This is because the language is highly **portable**. This means that almost every architecture has a valid C Compiler
which makes it almost impossible to truly eliminate. But the true problem is that C code can only be integrated in a limited subset of languages or
are harder to integrate into other languages' standard library. To solve this problem, the new unified language concept should be able to target a variety of backends, whether they be actual CPUs, or VMs, we intend to target as many as we can that are stable. This results a language that can be ported to any place.
We acknowledge the failed attempts of previous projects and hope to garner enough support to port many features from the community. This is why we have open-source in mind. To add features we want the community suggest them on our [feature request form](https://forms.gle/9nSVzipF8MYr8Q456).
Other than the compiler's design itself, we focus on project generation. If you have ever dealt with a web application, you would know that they have 
a great package manager setup as well as project generation. With so many backends targe

### How do the authors intend on gathering support?
We would first like to add our language to the [Programming Language Discord](#about) server and then proceed as the language gains gradual 
maturity. At the function stage, we would like to gather contributor and feature support. This is in the critical part of some of the language's 
core features that will be developed. This makes it quite important that everyone will have an oppurtunity to suggest and give ideas for the 
language.
