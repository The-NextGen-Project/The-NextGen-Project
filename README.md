# The NextGen Project


## What is the NextGen Project? 
The NextGen Project serves to create a modern, highly optimized, and flexible language and toolchain.
**[The Jet Programming Language](https://github.com/The-NextGen-Project/jet)** is designed to be application driven.
It serves to write code for a single application to be ported to Native, Mobile, and Web Targets as best it can.

## The Jet Programming Language
The language was made with a clear intention to include features heavily requested by other developers into a language. Its design is also made with careful
consideration of current programming paradigms as well modern programming languages used in the industry. We are focused on creating a language that is highly
productive as well as well-crafted. We do not want to give the language a bombardment of features (like C++), rather we will choose the best of existing modern paradigms 
and do the best we can to make as little comprimises as possible.

### Targets
The Jet Programming Language will target languages/backends that provide the most portability and performance.
Plans for targets include: **C**, **JavaScript**, **WASM**, and **Native CPU Architectures**.
These backends cover all bases when targetting code, and are highly performant in their respective environment.

#### Current Native Architectures
* [**x86_64**](https://github.com/The-NextGen-Project/wasm2bin)


## How do the authors intend on gathering support?
You may view or public display on the [r/Programming Language Discord](https://discord.gg/tft9Nw5jm6) **and** our [Jet Programming Language Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8cnuzFxZGx). During this time, we would intend to join other forums to discuss our language design in hopes of reaching a wider developer community
as well as communicate with developers in the industry such as: **Amazon**, **Google**, **JP Morgan**, and much more. We are the works of developing
a language with fast project deployment time, and ease of syntax, and practical for modern developers looking to get a job.

## Ok now this sounds great, but how do I contribute?
If you are reading this, you can make a change on our Github. To contribute, please see our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/The-NextGen-Project/jet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our policies that are listed there. Don't forget to read closely as to how to report issues and our code style guidelines as they are very important for maintining a good codebase. 

We are actively looking for others interested in this project, if you want to be apart of the organization. You may contact me at me email **[ashishbailkeri123@gmail.com]()** or message me on my discord **[aboss123#9435]()**
