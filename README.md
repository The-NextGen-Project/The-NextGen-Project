# The NextGen Project
### Unifiy Open Source Developers to Design a Language that they LOVE

About
-------
### What is the NextGen Project? 
The NextGen Project serves to be the hub for creating and synthesizing new and old open source projects
into a unified toolchain under the Jet Programming Language. The message remains: A toolchain made by Open Source Developers
for Open Source Developers.

### The Open Source Programming Language (JET)
This is the programming langauge that is made by Open Source Developers for Open Source Developers. The whole purpose is for all those alike to help contribute
to the language's development in order to create something amazing for everyone. Aren't there enough languages already? Yep, but who says we can't have another
one? I've seen lots of comments about certain syntax or design themes people wished were different in programming languages, well now is the chance to be apart 
of the Next Generation Programming Langauage.


### How do the authors intend on gathering support?
We would first like to add our language to the [Programming Language Discord](#about) server and then proceed as the language gains gradual 
maturity. At the function stage, we would like to gather contributor and feature support. This is in the critical part of some of the language's 
core features that will be developed. This makes it quite important that everyone will have an oppurtunity to suggest and give ideas for the 
language and its other tied together features.

### Ok now this sounds great, but how do I contribute?
If you are reading this, you can make a change in how we program forever. To contribute, please see our [Contributng Guidelines](https://github.com/The-NextGen-Project/jet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our policies that are listed there. Don't forget to read closely as to how to report issues and our code style guidelines as they are very important for maintining a good codebase.
